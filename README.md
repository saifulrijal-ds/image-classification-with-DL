# image-classification-with-DL (On Progress)
Guided project from Udemy: Complete 2020 Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Bootcamp (with a few adjustments)
1. Predict images using the pre-trained model from Keras package ([tensorflow.keras.application](https://keras.io/api/applications/). Includes image loading, pre-processing, loading models and predicting images. notebook: 'Pretrained_Image_Classification.ipynb'.
2. Image Classification with [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. Include get the data, pre-processing, build neural network Keras model, visualising learning with Tensorboard (On Progress). notebook: 'Keras_CIFAR10_Classification.ipynb'.
